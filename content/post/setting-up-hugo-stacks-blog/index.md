# Setting Up Hugo Theme Stack

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a fast and flexible static site generator that allows you to build websites quickly and easily. One of the many benefits of using Hugo is the variety of themes available. In this tutorial, we will cover the setup process for the [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) theme, which is a modern and elegant theme that is perfect for building portfolios, personal websites, and blogs.

</svg>
```

2. On Windows you can press the Windows key and . to bring up emojis to use as a favicon.
3. Save the SVG file as `favicon.svg` in the `static` directory of your Hugo project.
5. Add the following link tag to the `layouts/partials/head/custom.html` file:

    ```<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg">```

4. Run `hugo server` to view the site with the custom favicon.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

To host your Hugo site on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Push your changes to the repository on GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, navigate to the "Pages" section.
3. Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (usually main) and click "Save".
4. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your site.
5. Visit ```https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/``` in your browser to see your site live on GitHub Pages.
