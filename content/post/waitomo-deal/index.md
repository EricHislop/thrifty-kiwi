# How to Save Money at Waitomo Petrol Stations

Waitomo petrol stations offer a unique opportunity for customers to save money on fuel purchases. If you fill up with $100, for example, you can spin the wheel five times and potentially save up to $15 on your fuel purchase.

## Waitomo App Loyalty Program

Waitomo has a mobile app that allows you to take advantage of their loyalty program. Here's how it works:

1. Download the [Waitomo app](https://www.waitomo.co.nz/app) and create an account.

2. Once at the pump, select $20 in the app and fill up your vehicle.

3. Put the gas hose back in the machine and return to the app to spin the wheel for a chance to win Waitomo Moolah.

4. If you win, the prize will be automatically added to your Waitomo Moolah wallet in the app and will be auto-redeemed on your next in-app purchase at a Waitomo Fuel Stop.

5. Repeat the process by paying for another $20 of fuel each time to spin the wheel and potentially win more Waitomo Moolah.

## Waitomo SCRATCH to Win Promotion

In addition to their loyalty program, Waitomo also offers a promotion called "Waitomo SCRATCH to Win." Here are the details:

1. Purchase $150 or more via in-app purchases within a calendar month to unlock the opportunity to SCRATCH to win.

2. Your in-app spending will reset back to zero at the end of each calendar month.

3. If you win, the prize will be automatically added to your Waitomo Moolah wallet in the app and will be auto-redeemed on your next in-app purchase at a Waitomo Fuel Stop.

4. From time to time, Waitomo may change the minimum spend value to unlock the SCRATCH to win.

## Terms and Conditions

Before participating in the loyalty program or promotions, be sure to read and understand the [Waitomo App Terms and Conditions](https://www.waitomogroup.co.nz/waitomoapp-terms-conditions) and [FAQ](https://www.waitomogroup.co.nz/waitomoapp-faq).
